# ADR 030: Performance Budget Framework

*   **Status**: Accepted
*   **Date**: 2025-07-18
*   **Deciders**: Architecture Review Team
*   **Supersedes**: N/A
*   **Superseded by**: N/A

## Context and Problem Statement

The current system has no performance guarantees, making it vulnerable to performance degradation. Capabilities like SchemaValidator, RateLimiter, and MetricsCollector could become slow without early detection, leading to production issues.

Traditional monitoring (Prometheus alerts) only detects problems after they occur. We need proactive performance protection that prevents regressions from reaching production.

## Decision Drivers

*   **Quality Over Speed**: System must maintain performance standards without compromising correctness
*   **Early Detection**: Performance regressions should be caught before reaching production
*   **Consistency**: Single source of truth for performance expectations
*   **Automation**: Performance validation should be automated, not manual
*   **Transparency**: Performance budgets should be visible and understandable

## Considered Options

### Option A: Build-Time Only Budgets
*   CI micro-benchmarks validate performance budgets
*   No runtime enforcement
*   **Pros**: Prevents regressions from reaching production
*   **Cons**: No runtime protection against environmental issues

### Option B: Runtime Only Budgets  
*   Prometheus alerts based on performance budgets
*   No build-time validation
* **Pros**: Catches environmental performance issues
* **Cons**: Regressions reach production before detection

### Option C: Build-Time + Runtime Budgets
*   CI micro-benchmarks + Prometheus alerts using same numbers
*   **Pros**: Comprehensive protection, single source of truth
*   **Cons**: Slightly more complex implementation

## Decision Outcome

**Adopt Option C: Build-Time + Runtime Budgets**

### Implementation Details

1. **Performance Budget Definition**:
   ```yaml
   # capability_budgets.yaml
   schema_validator:
     max_latency_ms: 50
     max_memory_mb: 10
   rate_limiter:
     max_latency_ms: 10
     max_memory_mb: 5
   metrics:
     max_latency_ms: 5
     max_memory_mb: 2
   ```

2. **Build-Time Protection**:
   *   Micro-benchmark test suite using `pytest-benchmark`
   *   CI job validates p95 latency and memory usage against budgets
   *   Build fails if any capability exceeds budget
   *   Budget numbers committed to version control

3. **Runtime Protection**:
   *   Prometheus alert rules using same budget numbers
   *   Alerts: `CapabilityLatencyHigh`, `CapabilityMemoryHigh`
   *   No automatic bypass - alerts require human intervention

4. **Budget Management**:
   *   Budgets updated only through formal process with sign-off
   *   Changes require ADR or equivalent documentation
   *   Historical performance data tracked for trend analysis

### Budget Enforcement Philosophy

*   **No Automatic Bypass**: Performance budgets are contracts, not suggestions
*   **Fail Fast**: Build failures prevent regressions from reaching production
*   **Human Decision**: Only humans can decide to increase budgets
*   **Quality Preservation**: Performance issues must be fixed, not worked around

## Consequences

### Positive
*   **Proactive Protection**: Performance regressions caught before production
*   **Consistent Standards**: Single source of truth for performance expectations
*   **Automated Validation**: No manual performance testing required
*   **Quality Preservation**: System maintains performance standards

### Negative
*   **Build Complexity**: Additional CI job and test maintenance
*   **False Positives**: Environmental factors may cause build failures
*   **Budget Management**: Requires ongoing maintenance of performance budgets

### Risks
*   **Benchmark Stability**: Micro-benchmarks may be flaky
*   **Mitigation**: Robust benchmarking framework with retry logic
*   **Budget Drift**: Budgets may become outdated
*   **Mitigation**: Regular review process and trend analysis

## Implementation Timeline

*   **Week 1**: Define initial performance budgets and create `capability_budgets.yaml`
*   **Week 2**: Implement micro-benchmark test suite
*   **Week 3**: Add CI job and Prometheus alert rules
*   **Week 4**: Document budget management process

## Future Considerations

*   **Dynamic Budgets**: Consider environment-specific budgets (dev vs prod)
*   **Trend Analysis**: Automated detection of performance degradation trends
*   **Budget Optimization**: Machine learning for optimal budget setting
