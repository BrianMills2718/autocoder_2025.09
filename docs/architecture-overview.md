# AutoCoder4_CC Architecture Overview

**Purpose**: This document defines the **target architectural vision** for AutoCoder4_CC when development is complete. It represents the design goals and principles, NOT current implementation status.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This describes what the system **SHOULD BE**, not what currently works. For actual implementation status, see [roadmap-overview.md](roadmap-overview.md).

**Document Stability**: This architectural vision should remain stable during development. Implementation details and current status belong in roadmap documentation.

## System Mission

AutoCoder4_CC is a **natural language to deployed system pipeline** that transforms conversational requirements into production-ready, observable, and secure distributed systems.

### ü§ñ **Primary User Interface: Conversational AI**

**Users interact exclusively through a chatbot interface** - they describe what they want in natural language and receive a complete deployed system. Users do not need to understand:
- Component models or port semantics
- Blueprint YAML structures
- Policy configuration syntax
- Deployment manifests or orchestration

**The complexity is entirely hidden behind conversational interaction.**

### **Complexity Separation: Developer vs User Experience**

**Important Distinction**: The architectural complexity described in these documents applies to **AutoCoder development**, not **end-user experience**:

**üë®‚Äçüíª AutoCoder Development Complexity** (Internal):
- Blueprint parsing, validation pipelines, capability chains
- Component model semantics, port-based architecture
- LLM provider integration, generation pipeline stages
- ADR governance, security frameworks, observability systems

**üë§ End-User Experience** (External):
- Natural language conversation: "Build me a todo API"
- System receives deployed, working application
- Optional: View generated system documentation if curious
- No knowledge required of internal architecture

**Why This Matters**: External reviews may critique "complexity for users" without recognizing that users never interact with the complex internals - they only experience the simple conversational interface.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Input**: Natural language conversation ("Build me a todo API with user authentication")
- **Output**: **Enterprise-grade deployed system** with monitoring, security, and operational excellence built-in

**Enterprise Output Guarantees**:
- **Production Deployment**: Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests included
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, and health checks integrated
- **Security**: RBAC, input validation, and secrets management configured
- **Scalability**: Resource requirements and scaling guidelines documented
- **Reliability**: Fail-fast validation and error handling throughout

## Architectural Principles

### 1. **Blueprint-Driven Generation**
- **Architecture**: All systems defined via declarative YAML blueprints
- **Dual-File Truth**: `architecture.yaml` (environment-agnostic) + `deployment.yaml` (environment-specific)
- **Radical Explicitness**: No hidden state, implicit behavior, or external configuration
- **Validation**: JSON Schema-enforced blueprint validation
- **Details**: [blueprint-language.md](architecture/blueprint-language.md)

### 2. **Component-Based Composition**
- **Base Class**: Lightweight `ComposedComponent` base class architecture
- **Capability Injection**: Complex behavior via discrete, single-purpose Capabilities
- **No Inheritance**: Composition over inheritance for all system behavior
- **Port-Based Model**: Component roles derived from port topology (ADR-031)
- **Registry**: Centralized component discovery and validation
- **Details**: [component-model.md](architecture/component-model.md)

### 3. **Four-Stage Generation Pipeline**
1. **Stage 1: Architectural Compilation**: Natural Language ‚Üí Blueprint YAML (versioned IR)
2. **Stage 2: Code Generation**: Blueprint ‚Üí System Components (with LLM completions)  
3. **Stage 3: Validation & Hardening**: Components ‚Üí **Validated System** (testing and policy verification)
4. **Stage 4: Enterprise Deployment Generation**: Validated System ‚Üí **Production-Ready Running System** (Docker/K8s artifacts)

**Enterprise Deployment Generation**:
- **Docker**: Production-ready Docker Compose configurations with scaling
- **Kubernetes**: Complete K8s manifests (deployment, service, ingress, secrets)
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring, logging, and health checks
- **Security**: RBAC, sealed secrets, and security middleware
- **Details**: [generation-pipeline.md](architecture/generation-pipeline.md)

### 4. **Capability-Based Runtime**
- **Kernel**: Non-bypassable capabilities (security, observability, validation)
- **Performance**: Target P99 latency budgets for all capabilities (goals, not guarantees)
- **Policy**: SLA-based capability enforcement
- **Details**: [runtime-orchestration.md](architecture/runtime-orchestration.md)

### 5. **Two-Layer Fail-Hard Architecture**
- **AutoCoder System Layer**: Always fail-hard - generation, validation, and build processes halt immediately on any error
- **Generated System Layer**: Planned graceful degradation allowed, but with fail-hard boundaries when degradation itself fails
- **Capability Kernel**: Mandatory and fail-hard at both layers - no system can operate without core capabilities
- **Observability**: All failures tracked and correlated across both layers
- **Details**: [validation-framework.md](architecture/validation-framework.md)

### 6. **Security-First Design**
- **Cryptographic Policies**: Environment-specific algorithm enforcement
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets, sealed secrets for K8s
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- **Details**: [security-framework.md](architecture/security-framework.md)

### 7. **Observability Economics**
- **Sampling Policies**: Environment-specific log/metric sampling
- **Retention Budgets**: Cost-aware data retention strategies
- **Compliance**: Automated compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Details**: [observability.md](architecture/observability.md)

### 8. **Quality-Focused Generation** (Post-MVP: Deterministic Reproducibility)
- **Primary Goal**: Generate functionally correct, secure, observable systems
- **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive validation at every stage
- **Robust Output**: Working systems regardless of minor LLM response variations
- **Future Enhancement**: Perfect reproducibility via build.lock (post-MVP if needed)
- **Details**: [generation-pipeline.md](architecture/generation-pipeline.md)

### 9. **Multi-Provider LLM System**
- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
- **Intelligent Failover**: Automatic provider switching on failures
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time cost monitoring and budget management
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous provider health checks and diagnostics
- **Current Status**: P0.6 critical fixes addressing cost validation thresholds

### 10. **Verifiable Correctness by Default**
- **Strict Validation**: Aggressive validation at every pipeline stage
- **Fail-Hard Policy**: Validation failures stop the build immediately
- **Machine Evidence**: All architectural claims backed by verifiable tests
- **CI Integration**: Continuous verification of performance and security claims
- **Details**: [validation-framework.md](architecture/validation-framework.md)
