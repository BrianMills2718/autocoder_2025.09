### Decision Service Level Agreement (SLA)

#### Standard ADRs
- **Proposal to Decision**: 30 days maximum
- **Review Assignment**: 7 days from proposal submission
- **Initial Feedback**: 14 days from review assignment
- **Final Decision**: 30 days from proposal submission

#### Urgent ADRs
- **Proposal to Decision**: 7 days maximum
- **Review Assignment**: 24 hours from proposal submission
- **Initial Feedback**: 3 days from review assignment
- **Final Decision**: 7 days from proposal submission

#### Emergency ADRs
- **Proposal to Decision**: 48 hours maximum
- **Review Assignment**: 4 hours from proposal submission
- **Initial Feedback**: 24 hours from review assignment
- **Final Decision**: 48 hours from proposal submission

## ADR Queue Management

### Proposal Queue States

#### `submitted`
- **Description**: New proposal awaiting initial triage
- **SLA**: Reviewed within 7 days
- **Next Actions**: Assign to review cycle, request clarifications, or reject for insufficient detail

#### `in-review`
- **Description**: Assigned to review board for detailed evaluation
- **SLA**: Initial feedback within 14 days (7 days for urgent)
- **Next Actions**: Provide feedback, request revisions, or schedule for decision

#### `pending-revision`
- **Description**: Requires changes before proceeding to decision
- **SLA**: Author has 14 days to submit revisions
- **Next Actions**: Submit revisions or withdraw proposal

#### `scheduled`
- **Description**: Ready for final review and decision
- **SLA**: Decision within next scheduled ratification meeting
- **Next Actions**: Accept, reject, or request final clarifications

#### `accepted`
- **Description**: Approved for implementation
- **SLA**: Implementation tracking begins immediately
- **Next Actions**: Update architecture documentation, communicate decision

#### `rejected`
- **Description**: Not approved for implementation
- **SLA**: Rejection rationale provided within 3 days
- **Next Actions**: Document reasons, archive proposal

#### `superseded`
- **Description**: Replaced by newer ADR or made obsolete
- **SLA**: Update references within 7 days
- **Next Actions**: Update documentation, maintain historical record

### Queue Metrics and Monitoring

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Average time in queue**: Target < 20 days for standard ADRs
- **SLA compliance rate**: Target > 95% adherence to decision timelines
- **Queue depth**: Target < 10 proposals in active review
- **Revision cycle count**: Target < 2 revision cycles per proposal

#### Monthly Reporting
- Queue depth and composition analysis
- SLA compliance metrics
- Process improvement recommendations
- Historical decision velocity trends

## ADR Proposal Requirements

### Mandatory Sections
1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive statement of the decision
2. **Status**: Current state in the governance process
3. **Context**: Business and technical drivers for the decision
4. **Decision**: Specific choice being made
5. **Consequences**: Expected positive and negative outcomes
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated and rejection rationale

### Quality Gates
- **Technical Accuracy**: Verified by subject matter experts
- **Completeness**: All mandatory sections addressed
- **Clarity**: Understandable by technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Impact Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of system-wide effects

## Process Enforcement

### Compliance Monitoring
- **Automated Queue Tracking**: GitHub Actions monitor proposal status and SLA compliance
- **Weekly Compliance Reports**: Automated generation of queue status and SLA metrics
- **Escalation Procedures**: Automatic notifications for SLA violations

### Process Violations
- **Minor Violations** (missed SLA by 1-3 days): Warning notification to responsible parties
- **Major Violations** (missed SLA by >3 days): Escalation to engineering management
- **Chronic Violations**: Process review and potential governance structure changes

## Communication and Transparency

### Stakeholder Updates
- **Weekly Queue Summary**: Distributed every Tuesday after triage
- **Decision Announcements**: Immediate notification of accepted/rejected ADRs
- **Monthly Process Report**: Comprehensive review of governance effectiveness

### Documentation Maintenance
- **ADR Index Updates**: Within 24 hours of status changes
- **Architecture Documentation**: Updated within 7 days of ADR acceptance
- **Process Documentation**: Reviewed quarterly for continuous improvement

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical System Decisions
When architectural decisions are required to resolve critical system issues:

1. **Immediate Escalation**: Contact ADR Administrator and available review board members
2. **Emergency Review**: 4-hour response SLA for initial assessment
3. **Expedited Decision**: 48-hour maximum for final decision
4. **Post-Decision Review**: Formal ratification in next scheduled meeting

### Business Continuity
- **Backup ADR Administrator**: Designated secondary contact for process continuity
- **Minimum Review Quorum**: 2 review board members sufficient for emergency decisions
- **Decision Authority**: Technical leads authorized for time-critical emergency decisions

## Continuous Improvement

### Quarterly Process Review
- **Effectiveness Assessment**: Analysis of decision quality and process efficiency
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Collection of process improvement suggestions
- **Process Updates**: Implementation of approved governance improvements

### Annual Governance Audit
