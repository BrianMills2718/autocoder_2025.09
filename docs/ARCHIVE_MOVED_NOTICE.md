## Archive Purpose

The archive preserves:
- **Historical context** for project decisions and evolution
- **Development process documentation** showing how complex changes were planned
- **Superseded documentation** replaced by current implementations
- **Audit trail** of architectural decisions and strategic changes

**Note**: All content in the archive is historical/reference only. For current operational documentation, use the main `docs/` directory.

---

## Project Benefits

Moving the archive outside the project directory provides:
- ✅ **Cleaner project structure** - Only active documentation in main project
- ✅ **Reduced confusion** - Clear separation of historical vs current content  
- ✅ **Preserved context** - Historical information remains accessible
- ✅ **Professional appearance** - Project focuses on current, actionable content
- ✅ **Maintained audit trail** - Full project evolution preserved

The main project documentation now contains only current, actionable content while preserving full historical context in the external archive.
