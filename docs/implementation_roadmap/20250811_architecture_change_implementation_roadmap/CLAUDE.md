# Port-Based Architecture - Master Implementation Checklist

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED by [06_DECISIONS/STATUS_SOT.md](06_DECISIONS/STATUS_SOT.md) on 2025-01-15. Status claims here may be obsolete.**

*Date: 2025-01-14*
*Status: RESOLVING CRITICAL ISSUES*
*Current Phase: Addressing 5 blocking issues before implementation*

## 🎯 MISSION

Replace broken RPC-based component system (27.8% validation) with port-based architecture achieving 95% validation success and 1000+ msg/sec throughput.

## ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED (2025-01-14)

### Issue #1: Poor Organization ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Information scattered across 45+ files
**Solution**: Consolidated into clear structure (see REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md)
**Status**: Complete - organized into 6 main directories with clear hierarchy

### Issue #2: Import Bug ✅ ALREADY FIXED
**Problem**: Line 1492 bug broke ALL components
**Solution**: Import already corrected to `from autocoder_cc.components.composed_base import ComposedComponent`
**Status**: Verified working - validation should improve immediately

### Issue #3: Recipe System ✅ BUILT
**Problem**: 1000+ lines of docs but 0 implementation
**Solution**: Foundation implemented in `/autocoder_cc/recipes/`
**Status**: 13 recipes registered and working, expander tested

### Issue #4: Port Connection Protocol ✅ SPECIFIED
**Problem**: How ports discover and connect not defined
**Solution**: Complete specification in `03_SPECIFICATIONS/PORT_CONNECTION_PROTOCOL.md`
**Status**: Full protocol documented with examples

### Issue #5: Timeline Confusion ✅ REMOVED
**Problem**: Multiple conflicting estimates
**Solution**: All timeline estimates removed - using phases instead
**Status**: Document updated to use Phase A/B/C instead of weeks/days

## ⚡ PHASE 0: CRITICAL IMPORT BUG FIX (IMMEDIATE - 10 MINUTES)

### THE BUG THAT BREAKS EVERYTHING
**Location**: `autocoder_cc/blueprint_language/component_logic_generator.py` line 1492
**Current**: `from observability import ComposedComponent` (WRONG)
**Required**: `from autocoder_cc.components.composed_base import ComposedComponent` (CORRECT)

### FIX IT NOW
```bash
cd /home/brian/projects/autocoder4_cc

# Check current state
sed -n '1492p' autocoder_cc/blueprint_language/component_logic_generator.py

# Fix the import
sed -i '1492s/from observability import ComposedComponent/from autocoder_cc.components.composed_base import ComposedComponent/' \
    autocoder_cc/blueprint_language/component_logic_generator.py

# Verify fix
sed -n '1492p' autocoder_cc/blueprint_language/component_logic_generator.py
# Should show: from autocoder_cc.components.composed_base import ComposedComponent
```

**Expected Impact**: Validation rate should improve from 27.8% to ~40% immediately

## 📁 PHASE 1: DOCUMENTATION REORGANIZATION

### Critical Issues Found (per REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md)
- **45 files** in flat structure with ~30% redundancy
- **10+ conflicts** in specifications (schema versions, test formats, timelines)

## 📊 DECISION TRACKER

### Critical Decisions ✅ ALL MADE
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Asyncio vs Anyio | **ANYIO** (refactor) | Entire design depends on it |
| Blueprint Schema Version | **2.0.0** | Major breaking change |
| Trait System | **REMOVE** | Use config flags instead |
| Checkpoints | **SQLite per system** | File-based but structured |

### New Technical Decisions (From External Review)
| Decision | Choice | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Transformer Contract | **1→{0..1}** | Allows drop/filter naturally |
| Ingress Timeout | **503 + Retry-After** | Proper client behavior |
| Metrics | **Add buffer_utilization, message_age_ms** | Critical for debugging |
| Sink Behavior | **Concurrent drain** | Performance improvement |
| Merger Behavior | **Fair-ish with burst control** | Prevents starvation |
| PII Masking | **Simple field names** | Security without complexity |

## 📈 PROGRESS METRICS

### Documentation Phase ✅ COMPLETE
- Reorganization: 100% ✅ (45 files → organized structure)
- Consolidation: 100% ✅ (redundancy eliminated)
- Navigation: 100% ✅ (START_HERE.md created)

### Foundation Phase Progress
- Phase A (Infrastructure): 0% ⏳
- Phase B (Integration): 0% ⏳
- Phase C (Validation): 0% ⏳

### Implementation Phase
- Not started (blocked on foundation)

## 🚦 CURRENT STATUS

### What Exists ✅
- Ports implementation (needs anyio migration)
- Filter bug ALREADY FIXED (lines 310-317)
- Observability system works
- 70% of business logic salvageable

### What's Fictional ❌
- Recipe system (1000+ lines of docs, 0 code)
- Primitives (not implemented)
- Port-based test runner (doesn't exist)
- Database connection layer (schemas only)
- Migration tools (not built)

### What's Incompatible ⚠️
- Current test runner (RPC-based)
- Current generator (no recipe awareness)
- Current validation gate (wrong architecture)
- 14 files using asyncio instead of anyio

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **TODAY - Documentation Cleanup**:
   - [ ] Execute REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md Step 1 (create directories)
   - [ ] Start consolidating redundant files
   - [ ] Add FICTIONAL warnings to non-existent systems

2. **NEXT - Foundation Decisions**:
   - [ ] Make 4 critical decisions (asyncio, schema, traits, checkpoints)
   - [ ] Start asyncio → anyio migration
   - [ ] Begin primitives implementation

3. **THEN - Foundation Building**:
   - [ ] Complete Phase A tasks from BULLETPROOF_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
   - [ ] Get primitives working
   - [ ] Start recipe system

2. [ ] Critical decisions made (4 pending)
3. [ ] Primitives implemented and tested
4. [ ] Recipe system created and integrated
5. [ ] Test infrastructure upgraded to ports
6. [ ] One complete example working end-to-end

## 📊 TRUE READINESS

| Component | Documented | Exists | Works | Ready |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Documentation | 45 files | ✅ Yes | ❌ Chaos | ❌ |
| Recipe System | ✅ 1000+ lines | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ |
| Primitives | ✅ Specified | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ |
| Test Runner | ✅ Designed | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ |
| Database | ✅ Schemas | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ |
| Migration | ✅ Strategy | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ |

**Overall**: 100% documented, 0% implemented, 0% ready

## Summary

**Current Status (2025-01-14)**:
- ✅ All 5 critical issues resolved
- ✅ Documentation reorganized into clear structure
- ✅ Import bug already fixed
- ✅ Recipe system foundation built and tested (13 recipes)
- ✅ Port connection protocol fully specified
- ✅ Git rollback point created: `rollback-point-20250114`

**Key Findings**:
- Actual validation rate: 0% (not 27.8% - any improvement is good!)
- System generator: 2,199 lines (not 104K - manageable!)
- No backwards compatibility needed (aggressive approach OK)

**Implementation Approach**: 
### AGGRESSIVE - NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
See `FINAL_BULLETPROOF_AGGRESSIVE_PLAN.md` for complete details

**Next Steps (Aggressive)**:
1. Direct asyncio → anyio replacement (no parallel versions)
2. Delete 4 unnecessary validation gates (keep only 1)
3. Modify system_generator.py directly (no wrapper)
4. Create all 5 primitives at once
5. Fix whatever breaks

**Rollback Strategy**: `git checkout rollback-point-20250114`

**Focus**: Fast, aggressive implementation with git safety net
