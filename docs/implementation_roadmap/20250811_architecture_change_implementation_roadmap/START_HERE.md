## üìç You Are Here

- ‚úÖ **Planning Phase**: Complete (100%)
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Reorganization**: Complete
- ‚úÖ **Critical Decisions**: All Made
- ‚úÖ **External Review Integration**: Complete
- ‚è≥ **Foundation Building**: Ready to Start (see STATUS_SOT.md for 6-week timeline)
- ‚ùå **Implementation**: Blocked (waiting on foundation)

## üéØ Quick Navigation

### If You Want To...

#### Understand What's Wrong
‚Üí Read [01_CURRENT_STATE/CRITICAL_GAPS.md](01_CURRENT_STATE/CRITICAL_GAPS.md)
- 23 critical gaps between plan and reality
- 10 blocking issues that prevent any progress
- Clear identification of fictional vs real systems

#### Start Implementation
‚Üí Follow [FINAL_BULLETPROOF_AGGRESSIVE_PLAN.md](FINAL_BULLETPROOF_AGGRESSIVE_PLAN.md)
- **AGGRESSIVE APPROACH** - No backwards compatibility
- Direct replacement strategy (no parallel versions)
- Copy-paste ready commands
- Git rollback safety net: `rollback-point-20250114`

Alternative (careful approach): [02_IMPLEMENTATION/MASTER_GUIDE.md](02_IMPLEMENTATION/MASTER_GUIDE.md)

#### Review Decisions Made
‚Üí See [06_DECISIONS/CRITICAL_DECISIONS.md](06_DECISIONS/CRITICAL_DECISIONS.md)
- ‚úÖ All 4 critical decisions made
- Anyio chosen for async
- Blueprint Schema Version 2.0.0
- SQLite for checkpoints, no traits

#### Understand the Timeline
‚Üí Check [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
- Master checklist with all tasks
- Current progress tracking
- Realistic timeline (5-6 weeks total with optimizations)

## üìä Current State Summary

### What Actually Exists ‚úÖ
- Port implementation (but uses asyncio, needs migration)
- Filter bug already fixed
- 70% of business logic salvageable
- Observability system works
- **Recipe System**: 615 lines of working code (needs integration)

### What Needs Building ‚ùå
- **Primitives**: Not implemented anywhere (need 5 base classes)
- **Port-based test runner**: Doesn't exist
- **Database layer**: Only schemas, no implementation
- **Migration tools**: Not built

### What Exists But Needs Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Recipe System**: EXISTS at `autocoder_cc/recipes/` (615 lines total)
  - `registry.py`: 376 lines with 13 recipes
  - `expander.py`: 231 lines with RecipeExpander class
  - Needs ~30-50 LOC change in system_generator.py

### What's Incompatible ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Current test runner (RPC-based)
- Current generator (no recipe awareness)
- 14 files using asyncio instead of anyio

## üó∫Ô∏è Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Documentation Cleanup (1-2 days) üîÑ CURRENT
- Reorganize 45 files ‚Üí 25 files
- Eliminate redundancy
- Add FICTIONAL warnings

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-2) ‚è≥ NEXT
**Week 1**: Core Infrastructure
- Migrate asyncio ‚Üí anyio (14 files)
- Create 5 primitives (Source, Sink, etc.)
- Integrate existing recipe system with generator

**Week 2**: Integration
- Connect recipes to generator
- Create test infrastructure
- Build database layer

**Week 3**: Validation
- Update validation gate
- Create migration tools
- Test end-to-end

### Phase 2: Original Implementation (4 weeks) ‚ùå BLOCKED
- Cannot start until foundation complete
- See original plan in archived docs

## ‚úÖ Next Actions

### Today
1. Review [01_CURRENT_STATE/CRITICAL_GAPS.md](01_CURRENT_STATE/CRITICAL_GAPS.md)
2. Make 4 critical decisions in [06_DECISIONS/CRITICAL_DECISIONS.md](06_DECISIONS/CRITICAL_DECISIONS.md)
3. Start foundation work from [02_IMPLEMENTATION/MASTER_GUIDE.md](02_IMPLEMENTATION/MASTER_GUIDE.md)

### This Week
1. Complete asyncio ‚Üí anyio migration
2. Build primitive classes
3. Create recipe system

### Next 2 Weeks
1. Complete foundation building
2. Integrate all systems
3. Run first successful test

## üö® Do NOT Skip

1. **Foundation building is mandatory** - The system cannot work without it
2. **Recipe system must be built** - It doesn't exist despite extensive documentation
3. **Primitives must be implemented** - They are the core of the architecture
4. **Test infrastructure must be replaced** - Current one is incompatible

## Summary

**Reality**: We have beautiful documentation for a system that doesn't exist.

**Required**: Phase 1-2 (see STATUS_SOT.md for 6-week timeline), then 4 weeks for implementation.

**Total Timeline**: 6-7 weeks (not the original 4 weeks).

**Start Here**: Read the critical gaps, make decisions, then follow the implementation guide.
