# Approved Unit Tests

*Date: 2025-08-12*
*Status: APPROVED - Ready to Use*

## Summary

These unit tests effectively validate our critical performance fixes:
- Sink parallel consumption
- Merger fairness
- BufferStats metrics

## Test Coverage

### 1. test_sink_concurrency.py ✅
**What it tests:**
- Sink processes multiple inputs concurrently
- No starvation between inputs
- TaskGroup implementation works correctly

**Key assertions:**
- Both producers complete (100 items each)
- Counts match expected values
- No deadlock or hang

### 2. test_merger_fairness.py ✅
**What it tests:**
- Merger doesn't starve slow producers
- Round-robin rotation works
- Fair interleaving of sources

**Key assertions:**
- All items from both sources appear
- Slow items appear early (< index 20)
- No indefinite blocking of slow source

### 3. test_bufferstats_metrics.py ✅
**What it tests:**
- Buffer utilization calculation
- Message age tracking
- Shared stats between connected ports

**Key assertions:**
- Utilization ~0.5 when half full
- Message age > 0 after delay
- Metrics update on receive

## Test Quality Assessment

### Strengths:
1. **Realistic timing** - Uses actual async delays
2. **Full lifecycle** - Tests use `component.run()`
3. **Tolerance ranges** - Allows for timing variance
4. **Clear intent** - Each test has specific goal

### Good Practices Observed:
- Proper use of `pytest.mark.asyncio`
- Clean test setup with custom components
- Appropriate buffer sizes for testing
- Smart use of `anyio.create_task_group()`

## Implementation Notes

### To Run:
```bash
# Run all port tests
pytest tests/port_based/ -v

# Run with timeout (recommended during development)
pytest tests/port_based/ -v --timeout=20

# Run specific test
pytest tests/port_based/test_sink_concurrency.py -v
```

### Dependencies:
- pytest
- pytest-asyncio
- anyio
- Implemented components (Sink, Merger, BufferStats)

## Recommendation

**ACCEPT ALL TESTS AS-IS**

These tests effectively validate our critical performance improvements and should be included in the test suite immediately after implementing the corrected components.

### Next Test Needed:
Yes, request the `test_crash_recovery.py` for checkpoint manager - this would complete our v1 test coverage.
