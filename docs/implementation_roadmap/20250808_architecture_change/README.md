# AutoCoder4_CC Port-Based Architecture - FULL SWITCH Plan

## Overview

This documents the **FULL SWITCH** from RPC-based ComponentCommunicator to port-based architecture with 5 mathematical primitives. This is a **COMPLETE REPLACEMENT**, not a migration.

## Critical Decision: FULL SWITCH

- **Strategy**: COMPLETE REPLACEMENT of existing architecture
- **Compatibility**: NONE - clean break from old system
- **Timeline**: UNLIMITED - architectural beauty is priority
- **Success Target**: 100% deployment success with self-healing
- **Approach**: No incremental steps, no parallel systems, no compromises

## Problem Statement

### Current Architecture (BROKEN)
- Components use RPC-style communication via ComponentCommunicator
- 13 hardcoded component types with domain-specific logic
- Mock validator gives 27.8% false positives
- Real validator shows 0% success rate
- Import bug at line 1492 causing all failures

### Target Architecture (CORRECT)
- Components use typed ports with anyio.MemoryObjectStream
- 5 mathematical primitives: Source, Sink, Transformer, Splitter, Merger
- Recipes provide domain behavior via compile-time expansion
- Self-healing ensures 100% deployment success
- Clean, beautiful architecture with no technical debt

## Implementation Phases (NO TIMELINE)

### Phase 1: Port Infrastructure
- Build typed port system with Pydantic validation
- Implement async iteration protocol
- Create comprehensive tests
- Focus on architectural beauty

### Phase 2: Mathematical Primitives
- Implement 5 base types perfectly
- Each with clear port constraints
- Beautiful, clean abstractions
- No domain logic in primitives

### Phase 3: Recipe System
- Define all 13 domain recipes
- Compile-time expansion to primitives
- Clear recipe → primitive mapping
- Configuration-driven behavior

### Phase 4: Self-Healing Integration
- Transactional healing with rollback
- 5-level escalation chain
- Pattern database for observability (NO ML)
- Achieve 100% success rate

### Phase 5: Generation Pipeline
- REPLACE all generators
- New templates for port-based components
- Remove ALL RPC code
- Fix import bug (line 1492)

### Phase 6: Validation & Testing
- 100% success with self-healing
- No mocks anywhere
- Real integration testing
- Complete test coverage

## Success Criteria

### Must Achieve
1. **100% validation success** (with self-healing)
2. **Only 5 primitive types** (no 13 domain types)
3. **Pure port-based communication** (no RPC)
4. **All tests passing** (complete rewrite)
5. **Architectural beauty** (clean, maintainable)

### Evidence Required
- Real component communication logs showing port usage
- Message routing through typed streams
- Self-healing rollback demonstrations
- 100% validation on all test systems

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Strategy** | FULL SWITCH | Clean architecture requires clean break |
| **Compatibility** | NONE | No technical debt from compatibility layers |
| **Component Types** | 5 primitives | Mathematical purity and composability |
| **Recipes** | Compile-time | Runtime complexity avoided |
| **Self-Healing** | Transactional | Always preserve working state |
| **Pattern DB** | Observability only | NO ML/AI learning systems |
| **Buffers** | 1000 with backpressure | Prevent memory issues |
| **Errors** | Collector pattern | Centralized error handling |

## Critical Documents

### Strategy & Decisions
- **FINAL_STRATEGY_DECISION.md** - The definitive strategy
- **RESOLVED_UNCERTAINTIES.md** - All technical decisions
- **PLANNING_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** - Executive summary

### Technical Design
- **port_stream_recipe_design.md** - Complete architecture spec
- **SELF_HEALING_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md** - 100% success approach
- **complete_file_dependency_analysis.md** - 250+ files to replace

### Implementation
- **TEST_DRIVEN_MIGRATION_PLAN.md** - TDD approach
- **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Task tracking
- **START_HERE_CONTEXT.md** - Entry point for new readers

## Getting Started

### For New Readers
1. Read **START_HERE_CONTEXT.md** first
2. Review **FINAL_STRATEGY_DECISION.md**
3. Understand **port_stream_recipe_design.md**

### For Implementation
1. Start with **TEST_DRIVEN_MIGRATION_PLAN.md**
2. Create first test: `tests/test_ports.py`
3. Follow TDD cycle systematically
4. Track progress in **IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md**

## Key Concepts

### Port-Based Communication
- **Ports**: Typed interfaces to streams with validation
- **Streams**: anyio.MemoryObjectStream for data transport
- **Contracts**: Pydantic models enforce data correctness
- **Async**: Full async/await support with backpressure

### Mathematical Primitives
| Primitive | Inputs | Outputs | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Source | 0 | N | Generate data |
| Sink | N | 0 | Consume data |
| Transformer | 1 | 1 | Transform data |
| Splitter | 1 | N | Distribute data |
| Merger | N | 1 | Combine data |

### Recipe System
- **Compile-time**: Recipes expand during code generation
- **Configuration**: Domain behavior via configuration
- **Example**: Store = Transformer + {persistent: true}
- **No runtime overhead**: Pure primitives at runtime

### Self-Healing Approach
```
1. Checkpoint current state
2. Apply healing attempt (max 3 passes)
3. Validate improvement
4. Rollback if worse
5. Escalate: Component → AST → Template → Recipe → Blueprint
```

## Important Notes

### What This IS
- ✅ FULL SWITCH to new architecture
- ✅ COMPLETE REPLACEMENT of components
- ✅ UNLIMITED TIME for quality
- ✅ 100% SUCCESS with self-healing
- ✅ ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY priority

### What This IS NOT
- ❌ NOT a migration (full switch)
- ❌ NOT incremental (complete replacement)
- ❌ NOT backwards compatible (clean break)
- ❌ NOT time-constrained (unlimited time)
- ❌ NOT compromising (architectural beauty)

## Status

**Planning**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Implementation**: Ready to begin
**Next Step**: Create `tests/test_ports.py`
