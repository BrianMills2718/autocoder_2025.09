# AutoCoder4_CC

**A comprehensive natural language to deployed system pipeline that transforms conversational requirements into distributed systems with built-in observability and security frameworks.**

⚠️ **Current Status**: This project is in active development. For current system capabilities and limitations, see [Project Status](docs/roadmap-overview.md) which is the **single source of truth** for implementation status.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**New to AutoCoder?** Get started in under 30 minutes:

```bash
# Quick installation and first system generation
cd autocoder4_cc
python -m pip install -e .

# Generate your first system from natural language
python autocoder_cc/generate_deployed_system.py "Build me a todo API with user authentication"
```

## 🎯 What AutoCoder4_CC Does

**Input**: Natural language description  
*"Build me a todo API with user authentication and real-time notifications"*

**Target Output** (when complete):
- Microservices with component-based architecture
- Kubernetes deployment manifests  
- Monitoring and observability framework
- Security policies and authentication
- Database schemas and migrations
- API documentation and tests

⚠️ **Current Capabilities**: See [roadmap-overview.md](docs/roadmap-overview.md) for actual working features vs. planned architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **🔄 Four-Phase Pipeline**: Natural Language → Blueprint → Components → Deployment → Running System
- **🧩 Component-Based**: Port-based component semantics with capability injection
- **🛡️ Security-First**: Cryptographic policies, sealed secrets, RBAC by default
- **📊 Observable**: RED metrics, distributed tracing, cost-aware retention
- **🔧 Reproducible**: Deterministic builds with cryptographic integrity

## 🚀 Current Status

**See [Project Status](docs/roadmap-overview.md) for complete implementation status.**

⚠️ **Important**: [docs/roadmap-overview.md](docs/roadmap-overview.md) is the **single source of truth** for:
- Current system capabilities
- Known limitations and blockers  
- Implementation progress
- Development priorities

📋 **Architecture Vision**: [docs/architecture-overview.md](docs/architecture-overview.md) describes the target architecture and design principles (not current implementation status).
