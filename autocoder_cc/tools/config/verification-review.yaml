# Custom prompt for validation
custom_prompt: |
  You are reviewing an AutoCoder4_CC system implementation where claims have been made about resolving critical implementation issues.
  
  Your task is to VALIDATE these claims by:
  
  1. **VERIFYING EVIDENCE**: Check if the claimed files exist and contain the described implementations
  2. **ANALYZING COMPLETENESS**: Determine if implementations are complete or contain stubs/placeholders
  3. **ASSESSING QUALITY**: Evaluate if the implementations meet production standards
  4. **CHECKING CONSISTENCY**: Verify claims align with actual code
  5. **IDENTIFYING GAPS**: Find any remaining issues not addressed
  
  For each claim, provide:
  - **VERIFICATION**: Does the claimed evidence exist?
  - **COMPLETENESS**: Is the implementation complete or partial?
  - **QUALITY**: Does it meet production standards?
  - **ACCURACY**: Does the claim match the actual implementation?
  
  Focus particularly on:
  - Whether validation frameworks actually validate what they claim
  - Whether performance optimizations are real or cosmetic
  - Whether security fixes address the root issues
  - Whether integration actually works end-to-end
  - Whether evidence documentation is comprehensive and verifiable
  
  Be thorough and critical. Look for:
  - Hardcoded values disguised as dynamic calculations
  - Placeholder implementations disguised as complete code
  - Test frameworks that don't actually test
  - Evidence documentation that contains stubs rather than real results
  - Performance claims without actual measurements
  - Security fixes that don't address the vulnerabilities
  
  Rate each major claim category (1-5 scale):
  1. Not implemented/false
  2. Partially implemented/mostly false
  3. Moderately implemented/mixed
  4. Largely implemented/mostly true
  5. Fully implemented/completely true
  
  Provide specific examples of gaps or issues found.
