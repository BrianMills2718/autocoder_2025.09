# LLM Generation Failure Deep Investigation

**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Scope**: Deep Analysis of LLM Component Generation Failures  
**Purpose**: Investigate why frontier LLM (o3) is generating placeholder code and why retry/patching isn't working  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The system fails at LLM component generation with placeholder code detection, but this indicates deeper issues. Frontier models like OpenAI o3 should not generate placeholder code unless there are significant problems with:
1. **Context corruption**: Malformed or contradictory context being fed to the LLM
2. **Prompt construction**: Broken or confusing prompt assembly
3. **Retry logic**: Failure to properly retry and self-correct
4. **Model configuration**: Incorrect parameters or model selection
5. **Token limits**: Context truncation causing incomplete instructions

## üö® CRITICAL INVESTIGATION POINTS

### **PROBLEM 1: WHY IS A FRONTIER LLM GENERATING PLACEHOLDER CODE?**

**Context**: OpenAI o3 is a state-of-the-art model that should easily follow instructions to avoid placeholders.

**Potential Root Causes**:
1. **Corrupted Context**: The system prompt or context may contain contradictory instructions
2. **Token Limit Issues**: Prompt may be truncated, cutting off critical instructions
3. **Model Parameter Problems**: Incorrect temperature, max_tokens, or other parameters
4. **Prompt Assembly Bugs**: Logic errors in how prompts are constructed
5. **Context Leakage**: Previous failed attempts contaminating subsequent requests

**Investigation Needed**:
- Examine the exact prompt being sent to the LLM
- Check for prompt truncation or context window issues
- Verify model parameters are appropriate for code generation
- Look for prompt construction logic errors

### **PROBLEM 2: WHY ISN'T THE RETRY LOGIC WORKING?**

**Context**: The system has retry logic (`_call_llm_with_retries`) but fails after placeholder detection instead of retrying with corrected prompts.

**Potential Root Causes**:
1. **Validation Before Retry**: Code validation happens after all retries, not between them
2. **Static Prompts**: Retry logic doesn't modify prompts based on failure reasons
3. **Circuit Breaker**: May be triggering and preventing retries
4. **Exception Handling**: Validation failures may not trigger retry logic
5. **Retry Scope**: Retries may only handle API errors, not validation failures

**Investigation Needed**:
- Trace the exact flow from LLM call ‚Üí validation ‚Üí retry decision
- Check if validation failures trigger the retry mechanism
- Examine circuit breaker logic and thresholds
- Verify retry logic includes prompt adaptation

### **PROBLEM 3: CONTEXT AND PROMPT CONSTRUCTION ANALYSIS**

**Context**: The system constructs complex prompts with system context, component details, and requirements.

**Potential Issues**:
1. **Prompt Length**: May exceed model context window
2. **Conflicting Instructions**: System prompt vs. component prompt contradictions
3. **Context Formatting**: Malformed JSON or YAML in prompts
4. **Template Rendering**: Jinja2 or string formatting errors
5. **Character Encoding**: Unicode or escape sequence issues

**Investigation Needed**:
- Examine exact prompt content sent to LLM
- Check for prompt length vs. context window limits
- Look for contradictory instructions in different prompt sections
- Verify prompt formatting and escaping

### **PROBLEM 4: MODEL CONFIGURATION AND PARAMETER ISSUES**

**Context**: The system uses model-specific parameters and configuration.

**Potential Issues**:
1. **Model Identification**: "o3" may not be correctly mapped to actual model
2. **Parameter Mismatch**: Using wrong parameter names for the model
3. **Temperature Settings**: May be too high, causing inconsistent output
4. **Token Limits**: `max_tokens` or `max_completion_tokens` may be insufficient
5. **API Version**: Using deprecated API endpoints or parameters

**Investigation Needed**:
- Verify actual model being called by the API
- Check parameter compatibility with the model
- Examine token limits and response truncation
- Validate API endpoint and version

## üîç SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INVESTIGATIONS NEEDED

### **INVESTIGATION 1: PROMPT CONTENT ANALYSIS**

**Focus**: Examine the exact prompts being sent to the LLM

**Questions for Gemini**:
1. What is the exact content of the system prompt in `_get_system_prompt()`?
2. Are there contradictory instructions between system and user prompts?
3. Is the prompt length appropriate for the model's context window?
4. Are there formatting issues that could confuse the model?
5. Does the prompt clearly specify the expected output format?

**Files to Examine**:
- `blueprint_language/llm_component_generator.py` lines 243-454 (prompt construction)
- Check for template rendering errors or malformed context

### **INVESTIGATION 2: RETRY AND VALIDATION FLOW ANALYSIS**

**Focus**: Trace the exact execution flow from LLM call to retry decision

**Questions for Gemini**:
1. Does `_validate_generated_code()` get called before or after retry logic?
2. What triggers the retry mechanism - only API errors or also validation failures?
3. Does the retry logic modify prompts based on previous failures?
4. Are validation errors properly passed back to inform retry attempts?
5. Is the circuit breaker preventing legitimate retries?

**Files to Examine**:
- `blueprint_language/llm_component_generator.py` lines 64-167 (main generation flow)
- `blueprint_language/llm_component_generator.py` lines 168-241 (retry logic)
- `blueprint_language/llm_component_generator.py` lines 456-594 (validation logic)

### **INVESTIGATION 3: MODEL CONFIGURATION VERIFICATION**

**Focus**: Verify the actual model being used and its parameters

**Questions for Gemini**:
1. Is "o3" correctly mapped to the intended OpenAI model?
2. Are the API parameters (`max_completion_tokens` vs `max_tokens`) correct?
3. Is the temperature setting appropriate for code generation?
4. Are there API compatibility issues with the model version?
5. Is the timeout sufficient for complex code generation?

**Files to Examine**:
- `autocoder/core/config.py` (model configuration)
- `blueprint_language/llm_component_generator.py` lines 194-199 (API parameters)

### **INVESTIGATION 4: CONTEXT CORRUPTION ANALYSIS**

**Focus**: Look for context contamination or state issues

**Questions for Gemini**:
1. Is there state leakage between component generation attempts?
2. Are previous validation failures affecting subsequent prompts?
3. Is the component context (type, description, config) being corrupted?
4. Are there encoding or formatting issues in the context data?
5. Is the error handling properly isolating failures?

**Files to Examine**:
- Component context building in `_build_component_prompt()`
- Error handling and state management in the generation loop

## üîç SPECIFIC FAILURE PATTERN ANALYSIS

### **CURRENT FAILURE DETAILS**

From the user's output:
```
Component: user_event_stream (Source)
Generated: 5122 characters, 126+ lines
Error: Code validation failed: Generated code contains placeholders: 
['Placeholder constant return at line 53', 'Placeholder constant return at line 77']
```

**Critical Questions**:
1. **Why 5122 characters?** This is substantial code - what caused placeholder injection in specific lines?
2. **What's at lines 53 and 77?** What specific patterns triggered the validation?
3. **Why didn't retries happen?** Was this the first attempt or after multiple retries?
4. **What was the exact prompt?** Was it malformed or contradictory?

### **EXPECTED vs ACTUAL BEHAVIOR**

**Expected**:
1. LLM generates clean code without placeholders
2. If validation fails, system retries with improved prompts
3. Multiple attempts with different prompt variations
4. Eventual success or detailed failure analysis

**Actual**:
1. LLM generates substantial code but with placeholders
2. Validation correctly detects placeholders
3. System fails immediately without retry
4. No prompt adaptation or self-correction
