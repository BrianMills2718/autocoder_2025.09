notes: |
  This validation verifies the successful completion of Phase 1 component implementation
  work as specified in CLAUDE.md. The focus is on confirming that TaskAPI and TaskStore
  components have been implemented with full production functionality, including:
  
  - Complete FastAPI integration with real endpoints
  - Full CRUD operations with proper ID generation
  - Component lifecycle management
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 100% pass rate
  
  This represents a significant milestone in the AutoCoder4_CC development, moving from
  infrastructure setup to functional component implementation.
