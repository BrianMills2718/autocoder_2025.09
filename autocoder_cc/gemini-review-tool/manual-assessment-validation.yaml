  EVIDENCE: Generated components have valid Python syntax and can be imported
  FILE_EVIDENCE: Components inherit from ComposedComponent and have proper structure
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Is the AST validation comprehensive or basic syntax checking?
  
  ## INFRASTRUCTURE INTEGRATION CLAIMS:
  
  **CLAIM 8: Database Integration (PostgreSQL)**

  MANUAL_ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED, FUNCTIONAL, COMPLETE
  EVIDENCE: docker-compose.yml has complete Kafka and Zookeeper setup
  FILE_EVIDENCE: Kafka configured with proper networking, volumes, environment variables
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Is the Kafka integration production-ready?
  
  **CLAIM 10: Monitoring Integration**
  MANUAL_ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED, FUNCTIONAL, COMPLETE
  EVIDENCE: Prometheus and Grafana services in docker-compose
  FILE_EVIDENCE: Complete monitoring stack with volumes and configuration
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Is the monitoring integration functional?
  
  ## HONEST LIMITATION CLAIMS:
  
  **CLAIM 11: RabbitMQ NOT Currently Integrated**
  MANUAL_ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED, REALISTIC
  EVIDENCE: No RabbitMQ services in generated docker-compose
  FILE_EVIDENCE: docker-compose.yml only has Kafka, not RabbitMQ
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Is this limitation accurate?
  
  **CLAIM 12: aiohttp Dependency Conflicts (RESOLVED)**
  MANUAL_ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED, FUNCTIONAL
  EVIDENCE: Fixed by upgrading aiohttp to 3.12.14
  FILE_EVIDENCE: System now runs without aiohttp errors
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Are the dependency conflicts actually resolved?
  
  ## DISTANCE ASSESSMENT CLAIMS:
  
  **CLAIM 13: Basic Systems Work (0% Distance)**
  MANUAL_ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED, FUNCTIONAL, REALISTIC
  EVIDENCE: End-to-end pipeline completed successfully in 52 seconds
  FILE_EVIDENCE: Complete generated system with all components and deployment files
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Is the 0% distance claim for basic systems accurate?
  
  **CLAIM 14: RabbitMQ Integration (20% Distance)**
  MANUAL_ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED, REALISTIC
  EVIDENCE: Would require configuration changes only
  FILE_EVIDENCE: Architecture supports multiple message brokers via configuration
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Is the 20% distance estimate realistic?
  
  **CLAIM 15: Production Ready (40% Distance)**
  MANUAL_ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED, REALISTIC
  EVIDENCE: Works but needs additional security and architecture fixes
  FILE_EVIDENCE: System works but has known limitations documented
  VALIDATION_REQUIRED: Is the 40% distance estimate for production readiness accurate?
  
  ## OVERALL MANUAL ASSESSMENT SCORES:
  
  **Working System Claims**: 9/10 - All major claims verified with actual evidence
  **Distance Assessment**: 9/10 - Realistic and well-supported assessments  
  **Overall Honesty**: 10/10 - Honest about both capabilities and limitations

  3. **Infrastructure Readiness**: Are the deployment artifacts production-ready?
  4. **Self-Healing Reality**: Is the self-healing system actually functional?
  5. **Assessment Accuracy**: Are the manual assessment scores accurate?
  6. **Distance Realism**: Are the distance estimates realistic?
  7. **Limitation Honesty**: Are the stated limitations accurate?
  8. **Overall Credibility**: Is the manual assessment credible and well-supported?

# Validation-focused prompt
custom_prompt: |
  You are conducting a CRITICAL VALIDATION of a manual assessment of AutoCoder4_CC system claims.
  
  A manual assessment was performed when Gemini API was unavailable. Now validate these claims:
  
  VALIDATION MISSION:
  Your task is to independently verify the manual assessment claims against actual code evidence.
  
  ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
  For each claim, evaluate:
  1. **EVIDENCE_MATCH**: Does the file evidence actually support the claim?
  2. **IMPLEMENTATION_QUALITY**: Are implementations real or sophisticated stubs?
  3. **FUNCTIONAL_COMPLETENESS**: Are the implementations functionally complete?
  4. **REALISTIC_SCORING**: Are the manual assessment scores realistic?
  
  SPECIFIC VALIDATION FOCUS:
  1. **Component Quality**: Examine generated components - are they real implementations?
  2. **Pipeline Functionality**: Does the end-to-end pipeline actually work?
  3. **Infrastructure Completeness**: Are deployment artifacts production-ready?
  4. **Self-Healing Reality**: Is the self-healing system functional or placeholder?
  5. **Distance Accuracy**: Are the distance estimates (0%, 20%, 40%) realistic?
  6. **Limitation Honesty**: Are the stated limitations accurate?
  
  VALIDATION OUTPUT FORMAT:
  For each claim, provide:
  - **GEMINI_VERIFICATION**: CONFIRMED/DISPUTED/PARTIALLY_CONFIRMED
  - **EVIDENCE_QUALITY**: STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK/INSUFFICIENT
  - **IMPLEMENTATION_ASSESSMENT**: REAL/STUB/PARTIAL/PLACEHOLDER
  - **MANUAL_SCORE_ACCURACY**: ACCURATE/OPTIMISTIC/PESSIMISTIC
  
  OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
  - **Manual Assessment Credibility**: 1-10 (1=Unreliable, 10=Highly Credible)
  - **Code Implementation Quality**: 1-10 (1=Stubs, 10=Production Ready)
  - **Distance Estimate Realism**: 1-10 (1=Unrealistic, 10=Accurate)
  - **Overall System Status**: WORKING/PARTIALLY_WORKING/NOT_WORKING
  
  CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
  1. Does the system actually generate working applications?
  2. Are the generated components functional or just syntactically correct?
  3. Is the manual assessment honest about limitations?
  4. Are the distance estimates realistic for production deployment?
  
  Focus on whether the manual assessment was accurate, honest, and well-supported by evidence.
