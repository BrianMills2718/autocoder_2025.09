# Evidence: Week 2 Execution Diagnosis

**Date**: 2025-08-27
**Task**: 2.1-2.2 Diagnose Execution Issues

## Diagnosis Summary

### Current State
- **Level 3 Confirmed**: Imports work ‚úÖ
  - Components can import `observability` module
  - Components can import each other
  - sys.path fix from Week 1 is working

- **Level 4 Blocked**: Execution fails ‚ùå
  - main.py hangs indefinitely when executed
  - Component validation failures during generation
  - Self-healing attempts fail

### Specific Issues Identified

#### 1. Generation Validation Errors
```
üö® 2 components failed validation
‚ùå Self-healing failed after 2 attempts
Component generation with healing failed: Components failed validation even after healing attempts
```

#### 2. main.py Execution Hang
- When running `python3 main.py`, the process hangs indefinitely
- No immediate crash, but also no progress
- Timeout required to terminate process

#### 3. Test Results from /tmp/test_gen/scaffolds/quick_test_system

**Import Tests**:
```
‚úÖ Can import observability
‚úÖ Can import test_source
```

**Execution Test**:
```
Command '['/usr/bin/python3', 'main.py']' timed out after 2 seconds
```

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 1: Async Event Loop
- **Likely Cause**: main.py may be missing proper async event loop setup
- **Symptom**: Process hangs waiting for async operations
- **Evidence**: Timeout on execution, no error output

#### Issue 2: Component Validation
- **Cause**: Components generated don't pass validation tests
- **Evidence**: Self-healing system reports validation failures
- **Impact**: Components may have structural issues

#### Issue 3: Missing async/await Consistency
- **Hypothesis**: Some methods may be sync when they should be async
- **Next Step**: Need to check all process methods for async consistency

## Files Generated for Testing

1. `/tmp/test_gen/scaffolds/quick_test_system/` - Test system
2. Components generated:
   - test_source.py
   - test_sink.py
   - observability.py
   - communication.py

## Next Steps

1. Check main.py for proper async setup
2. Analyze component methods for async consistency
3. Fix configuration handling issues
4. Ensure proper component instantiation

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Generation test
python3 -m autocoder_cc.cli.main generate "Quick Test" --output test_gen

# Import test
cd /tmp/test_gen/scaffolds/quick_test_system
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'components'); from observability import ComposedComponent"

# Execution test
timeout 1 python3 main.py
```

## Conclusion

Level 3 (Imports Work) is confirmed working, but Level 4 (Execution Works) is blocked by:
1. main.py hanging (likely async issue)
2. Component validation failures
3. Potential async/await inconsistencies

These issues must be resolved in Tasks 2.3-2.4.
