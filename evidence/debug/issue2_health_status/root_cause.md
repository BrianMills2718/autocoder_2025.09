# Root Cause Analysis: Health Status Issue

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Issue**: System reports "unhealthy" when all components are healthy  
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✅

## Problem Statement
The `/health` endpoint reports overall status as "unhealthy" even though all components report `healthy: true`.

## Investigation Process

### 1. Health Response Analysis
```json
{
  "status": "unhealthy",  // Overall status
  "components": {
    "test_data_store": {
      "healthy": true,    // Component is healthy
      ...
    },
    "test_data_source": {
      "healthy": true,    // Component is healthy
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

All components report `healthy: true` but overall status is "unhealthy".

### 2. Code Analysis
Found the health aggregation logic in `main.py`:

```python
if health.get('status') != 'healthy':
    overall_healthy = False
```

### 3. Data Structure Mismatch
The code checks for `health['status'] == 'healthy'` but components return:
```python
{
  'healthy': true,           # Boolean field
  'status': {                # Status is a nested object!
    'is_running': false,
    'is_healthy': true,
    ...
  }
}
```

## Root Cause
**Health Check Field Mismatch**

The health aggregation logic looks for a string `status` field equal to "healthy", but:
1. Components use a boolean `healthy` field (correct)
2. They have a nested `status` object (not a string)
3. The check `health.get('status') != 'healthy'` always fails because `status` is an object, not a string

## Impact
- System always reports "unhealthy" regardless of actual component health
- This is a bug in the health aggregation logic, not the components
- Components are correctly reporting their health status

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix Health Check Logic (Recommended)
Change main.py to check the correct field:
```python
if not health.get('healthy', True):  # Check boolean 'healthy' field
    overall_healthy = False
```

### Option 2: Check Nested Status
```python
status_obj = health.get('status', {})
if isinstance(status_obj, dict) and not status_obj.get('is_healthy', True):
    overall_healthy = False
```

### Option 3: Standardize Response Format
Make components return `status: 'healthy'` as a string instead of the current structure.

## Verification
When we check the actual fields:
- `test_data_store`: `healthy=True` ✅
- `test_data_source`: `healthy=True` ✅
- Overall status should be "healthy" but reports "unhealthy" ❌

## Conclusion

The health status issue is a **simple field name mismatch** in the aggregation logic. The system should check the boolean `healthy` field instead of looking for a string `status` field. This is a minor bug that's easily fixable and doesn't affect actual component functionality.
