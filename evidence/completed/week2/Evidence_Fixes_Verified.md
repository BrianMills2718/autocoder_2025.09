# Evidence: Fixes Verified

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Status**: ✅ Both fixes verified and working

## Fix 1: Action Name Adapter

**Problem**: Components expected verbose action names like "add_item" but were receiving common names like "store"

**Solution**: Created `component_action_adapter.py` to translate action names

**Verification**:
```
✅ store      -> add_item        : success
✅ list       -> list_items      : success
✅ retrieve   -> get_item        : error (expected - item doesn't exist)
```

## Fix 2: Health Aggregation Logic

**Problem**: Health check was looking for wrong field, causing false "unhealthy" status

**Solution**: Fixed health check logic in main.py:
- Line 192: Check boolean `health.get('healthy', True)` instead of string comparison
- Line 195: Added `healthy: True` field for components without health_check
- Line 197: Added `healthy: False` field for exception cases

**Verification**:
```
Overall status: healthy
Component health:
- test_data_store: healthy=True
- test_data_source: healthy=True

✅ SUCCESS: Health check correctly reports 'healthy'
✅ All components have healthy=True
✅ Fix 2 is working correctly!
```

## Files Modified

1. `/tmp/test_level4/scaffolds/test_system/main.py`:
   - Lines 192-198: Fixed health aggregation logic

2. Created `/home/brian/projects/autocoder4_cc/component_action_adapter.py`:
   - Translates common action names to component-specific ones
   
3. Created `/home/brian/projects/autocoder4_cc/ACTION_NAME_REFERENCE.md`:
   - Documents correct action names for all components

## Impact

These fixes enable:
- Proper component testing with correct action names
- Accurate health status reporting for monitoring/orchestration
- Better debugging with clear action name documentation

## Next Steps for Generator Fix

To fix these issues in the generator itself:

1. **Action Names**: Update component templates to accept common action aliases
2. **Health Logic**: Fix health aggregation template in main_generator.py

The fixes work for existing generated systems but should be incorporated into the generator for future systems.
