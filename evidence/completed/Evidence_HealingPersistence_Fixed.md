# Evidence: Healing Persistence Test Fixed

**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Status**: FIXED âœ…

## Problem Identified

The blueprint healer was not detecting schema mismatches in bindings that used the alternative format:
```yaml
bindings:
  - from_component: source1
    from_port: output
    to_component: store1  # Singular form
    to_port: input
```

The code was only checking for `to_components` (plural) but not `to_component` (singular).

## Root Cause

In `autocoder_cc/healing/blueprint_healer.py`, line 632, the code only handled the plural form:
```python
if not to_part and "to_components" in binding:  # Only checking plural
```

This caused the binding parsing to fail, so schema mismatches were never detected.

## Solution Applied

Updated the condition to handle both singular and plural forms:
```python
if not to_part and ("to_components" in binding or "to_component" in binding):
    # Handle both plural and singular forms
    if "to_components" in binding:
        # ... existing plural logic
    elif "to_component" in binding:
        to_component = binding.get("to_component")
        to_port = binding.get("to_port", "input")
        to_part = f"{to_component}.{to_port}"
```

## Verification

### Direct Healing Test
```python
healer = BlueprintHealer()
healed = healer.heal_blueprint(blueprint, phase='schema')
```

**Result**: 
- âœ… Schema mismatch detected: `common_object_schema -> ItemSchema`
- âœ… Transformation added: `convert_common_object_schema_to_ItemSchema`

### Full Test Results
```
=== TESTING HEALING PERSISTENCE ===

Attempt 1:
  Before healing: transformation = False
  After healing: transformation = convert_common_object_schema_to_ItemSchema

Attempt 2:
  Before healing: transformation = True
  After healing: transformation = convert_common_object_schema_to_ItemSchema

âœ… SUCCESS: Transformation persists across attempts

=== TESTING PARSER INTEGRATION ===
âœ… PASSED

RESULTS:
  Healing Persistence: âœ… PASSED
  Parser Integration: âœ… PASSED

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! Healing persistence is fixed.
```

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `autocoder_cc/healing/blueprint_healer.py` - Lines 632-642

### What the Fix Does
1. Detects bindings using `to_component` (singular) format
2. Properly parses the to_component and to_port fields
3. Enables schema mismatch detection for these bindings
4. Allows transformations to be added when mismatches are found

### Impact
- Healing now works for both binding formats
- Schema mismatches are properly detected and fixed
- Transformations persist across multiple healing attempts
- Test `test_healing_persistence.py` now passes

## Conclusion

The healing persistence issue has been successfully resolved by fixing the binding format detection logic. The healer now properly handles both singular (`to_component`) and plural (`to_components`) binding formats, enabling schema mismatch detection and transformation addition for all binding types.
