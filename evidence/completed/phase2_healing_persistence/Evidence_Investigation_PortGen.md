=== TESTING PORT GENERATOR BINDING AWARENESS ===

Original blueprint:
  Store input port: data
  Binding target: event_store.data

=== CURRENT BEHAVIOR ===
Port generator changes Store.data â†’ Store.input (from template)
But does NOT update the binding
Result: Binding points to non-existent port

=== POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS ===

Option A: Leave binding broken (current behavior)
  Pros: Simple, healer can fix it
  Cons: Creates unnecessary work for healer

Option B: Update binding to match new port name
  Pros: Maintains consistency
  Cons: Complex to implement, may break user intent

Option C: Preserve original port if referenced in binding
  Pros: Respects existing bindings
  Cons: May not enforce proper port schemas

Option D: Add both ports (original + template)
  Pros: Backward compatible
  Cons: May create confusion with multiple ports

=== ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS ===
Blueprint is LLM-generated, so modifications are allowed
Broken bindings should fail validation, not be silently ignored
Store template enforces correct port structure

=== RECOMMENDATION ===
Option C: Preserve original port if referenced in binding
Rationale:
  1. Respects LLM-generated bindings
  2. Healer can add transformations for schema mismatches
  3. Avoids breaking existing connections
  4. Aligns with auto-healing philosophy

=== WOULD THIS SOLVE THE ISSUE? ===
If port generator preserves 'data' port when referenced:
  - Binding remains valid
  - Healer adds transformation for schema mismatch
  - Transformation persists (with stateful healing)
  - System generates successfully

Conclusion: YES, but requires port generator modification

Note: This is an investigation test, not a pass/fail test
