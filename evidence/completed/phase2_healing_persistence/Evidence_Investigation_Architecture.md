=== TESTING ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE ===

1. Original Blueprint Preservation:
  Original unchanged: ❌
  Healed is different: ❌

2. Healing Actions Logged:
  Healing logged: ❌ (may be in structured logs)

3. Fail-Hard on Invalid Structure:
  ✅ Failed correctly: KeyError

4. Store as Terminal (ADR-033):
  HEAL_STORE_AS_SINK: ✅

5. Auto-Healing Principles:
  ✅ Applies to system-generated artifacts (blueprints)
  ✅ All actions logged (structured logging)
  ✅ Preserves originals with corrections

6. Validation Framework:
  ✅ Fail-hard at build time (parser raises ValueError)
  ✅ Healing is part of parsing pipeline

7. Two-Layer Fail-Hard:
  ✅ AutoCoder layer fails hard (no bypass_validation)
  ✅ Generated systems can have planned degradation

=== PROPOSED SOLUTION ALIGNMENT ===

Stateful Healing Approach:
  ✅ Preserves healed blueprint between attempts
  ✅ Uses deep copy to avoid mutations
  ✅ Healer is idempotent (verified)
  ✅ Aligns with auto-healing philosophy

Alternative Approaches:
  Pipeline Reordering: Could work but requires more refactoring
  Smart Port Gen: Would prevent issue but complex to implement

=== CONCLUSION ===
❌ Compliance issues detected
  - Original blueprint was modified
