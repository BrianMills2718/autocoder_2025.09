# Evidence: Level 5 Success Criteria

**Date**: 2025-08-27 14:50:00  
**Purpose**: Define what constitutes Level 5 achievement

## Level 5 Requirements

Level 5 represents a fully functional system where all components work together seamlessly.

### 1. API Functionality ✅ 
All HTTP endpoints must respond correctly:
- `/health` - Returns system health status
- `/metrics` - Returns Prometheus metrics  
- `/ready` - Returns readiness status
- `/docs` - Returns OpenAPI documentation
- Custom component endpoints (if any)

### 2. Data Flow ⏳
Components must pass data through the pipeline:
- Source components generate data
- Transformers process data
- Stores persist data
- Data flows from input ports to output ports
- Bindings connect components correctly

### 3. Persistence ⏳
System must maintain state across restarts:
- Stored data survives process restart
- Configuration is loaded correctly
- State is recoverable

### 4. Monitoring ✅
Health and metrics endpoints must work:
- Health check aggregates component status
- Metrics expose Prometheus format
- Logging captures component activity
- Observability traces span operations

### 5. Integration ⏳
Full system must run indefinitely without errors:
- No crashes under normal operation
- Graceful error handling
- Resource cleanup on shutdown
- Memory usage stays stable

## Test Cases for Level 5

- [ ] Generate system with 3+ components (source, transformer, store)
- [ ] System starts without errors (python main.py runs)
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly (/health returns 200)
- [ ] Data flows from source → transformer → store
- [ ] System handles 1000+ requests without crash
- [ ] Graceful shutdown works (SIGTERM handling)
- [ ] Memory usage stable over time
- [ ] Logs show component activity
- [ ] Metrics increment correctly
- [ ] Component communication works

## Current Status (Based on Week 2 Analysis)

### What's Working (Level 4)
- ✅ Components instantiate
- ✅ process_item() executes
- ✅ Health endpoints respond
- ✅ API documentation works
- ✅ No AttributeErrors

### What's Not Working (Blocking Level 5)
- ❌ Component communication (missing set_registry)
- ⚠️ Data flow between components (untested)
- ⚠️ Persistence (untested)
- ⚠️ Long-running stability (untested)

## Success Metrics

Level 5 is achieved when:
1. All test cases above pass
2. System runs for 5+ minutes without error
3. 100+ data items flow through pipeline
4. No memory leaks detected
5. All endpoints respond correctly

## Verification Method

```bash
# Generate test system
python -m autocoder_cc.cli.main generate "Data Pipeline" --output /tmp/test_level5

# Start system
cd /tmp/test_level5/scaffolds/*/
python main.py &

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/docs

# Send test data
python send_test_data.py

# Monitor for 5 minutes
sleep 300

# Check still running
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Evidence Required

To claim Level 5 achievement:
1. Screenshot/log of system running for 5+ minutes
2. Health check showing all components healthy
3. Metrics showing data processed
4. Log showing data flow through pipeline
5. Memory usage graph showing stability
