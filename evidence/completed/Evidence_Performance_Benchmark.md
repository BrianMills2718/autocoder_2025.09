# Evidence: Performance Benchmark
Date: 2025-08-29

## Benchmark Setup
- 100 components in blueprint
- 100,000 iterations
- Comparing direct access vs BlueprintContract.get_components()

## Test Execution
```bash
python3 benchmark_contract.py
```

## Results
```
Direct access time: 0.002349s
Contract access time: 0.018863s
Performance overhead: 703.05%
```

## Analysis

### Why the High Overhead?
1. **Microbenchmark Effect**: Testing only the access operation in isolation
2. **Function Call Overhead**: Additional function call and checks
3. **Structure Detection**: Contract checks for nested vs flat structure

### Real-World Impact
- **Negligible in Practice**: Blueprint access is a tiny fraction of total processing time
- **Actual Operations**: Component generation, validation, and deployment take seconds/minutes
- **Relative Impact**: 16ms difference over 100,000 operations = 0.16 microseconds per call

### Optimization Opportunities (If Needed)
1. Cache structure type after first check
2. Use inline functions for hot paths
3. Pre-compile regex patterns

## Verdict
⚠️ HIGH OVERHEAD IN MICROBENCHMARK
✅ ACCEPTABLE IN REAL-WORLD USAGE

The overhead is significant in isolation but negligible in actual system operation where:
- Blueprint parsing happens once per system generation
- Component generation takes seconds per component
- The safety and maintainability benefits outweigh microsecond-level overhead
